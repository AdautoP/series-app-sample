## ðŸ§± Architecture

The app follows a layered and modular architecture:

### Layers
- **View Layer**: Built entirely with SwiftUI and uses `ObservableObject` + `@Published` state management.
- **ViewModel Layer**: Pure and testable. Handles business logic, state, and routing triggers.
- **Service Layer**: Abstracted protocols and implementations for fetching data from the API.
- **Routing Layer**: Coordinators built around `NavigationStack`, `fullScreenCover`, and `sheet`, managed via enums.

### Features
- Debounced search with separate state
- Lazy loading for pagination (except favorites)
- Modular view composition using protocols
- ViewModel-driven routing (e.g., `ShowsListRouterType`)
- Loadable state wrapper (`LoadableState<T>`) for consistent async handling
- Core Data support for storing favorite shows
- Unit tests with mocked dependencies

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

This project uses:
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- CoreData (via `NSPersistentContainer`)
- XCTest for unit testing

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests

Each `ViewModel` and service is fully unit tested with mocked services and coordinators.

Example of test naming convention:
```swift
func testMethodName_WhenConditionHappens_ThenExpectResult()
